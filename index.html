                Bunnies are earresistably cute, with their soft noses, long ears, and floofy tails. No surprise theyre
                amongst the most popular pets in the UK, right after dogs and cats, because - lets be honest - nobunny
                compares to these hoppy companions.
                But the sweet floofs arent easily contained by a cage. Theyre full of bunny beans and love to zoom and
                binky. The secret to truly happy rabbits? Letting them roam freely in your home. Come find out about the
                life of Kavee's own free-roam rabbit, the gorgeous Coco, and why you should free-roam your rabbit, plus
                the
                dreaded question - how to toilet-train your sweet buns!
                Head over to our rabbit glossary to learn the A to Z for bunnies!

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">1. How do free-roaming rabbits live?</h3>
            <p>
                A free-roam rabbit lives in a home with their pet parents and bunny friends… but heres the twist: they
                dont
                live in a cage. Free-roam house rabbits hop about their pet parents home whenever they like. They are
                free
                to roam, you might say.
                Some bunny owners keep their free-roaming rabbit in the bedroom, or they use a special room as the
                free-roam
                rabbit set-up, just for their rabbits rapture. Most of the time, they keep the free-roam rabbits on
                carpet
                as the comfiest option for the floofs (and ourselves when cuddling the buns!). Others let their beloved
                bunnies run around the entire home - as long as its safe for them to do so.
                Coco, Kavee's free-roam house rabbit, has a room to binky in, and goes on daily adventures in her bunny
                parents' home. The bold bun is a master at chewing important cables, so her hoomans are on constant
                bunny
                watch.
                One things clear: any free-roaming rabbit set-up is a huge improvement on the pet shop rabbit cages in
                the
                olden days. So is it safe to say that free-roaming house rabbits are happier? Lets find out!

            <h3>2. Are free-roam rabbits happier?</h3>
            <p>
                When rabbits get to free-roam, theres naturally more to explore and keep them busy. Experienced
                free-roam
                rabbit owners, like Coco's bunny parents, add toys and enrichment to their homes to keep their buns
                entertained - and the wallpaper safe. Coco's room and toys are moved around regularly, so she explores
                her
                free-roaming rabbit set-up with fresh eyes and leaves her hoomans' valued possessions alone.
                But how do you keep your free-roaming house rabbit safe?

            <h3>3. How to keep your free-roam rabbit safe</h3>
            <p>
                The first step to keeping your beloved bunnies safe in your home is understanding how they behave. And
                once
                youve learned to think like a bun, itll be much easier to bunny-proof your home for your free-roam house
                rabbit!

            <h3>4. Bunny-proofing your home for beginner bunny parents
            </h3>
            <p>
                So how can you keep your buns separate from all wires? You can block off wiry areas with home-made
                fencing
                (C&C grids are great for this!), or move the cables, so your free-roam rabbit cant get to them. But
                heres
                the tricky situation: bunnies can stand on their hindlegs, so its important that the smart floofers cant
                reach the wires under any circumstances. Take it from Coco's hoomans, who had to replace a cable or two
                (or
                ten!) since their furry friend moved in.
                Some bunny owners get solid cable guards to stop their companions from doing something theyll later
                regret.
                But wires arent the only household objects in danger of getting the bunny treatment in your free-roam
                rabbit
                set-up…</p>

            <h3>4. Healthy, Hoppy Hares in your Home</h3>
            <p>
                One thing that many new free-roam house rabbit owners forget about is their pets healthcare. Of course,
                the
                annual check-up is important for all bunnies, but what about flea treatment? Vaccinations? Neutering?
                Those
                things are just for outdoor rabbits, right? Nope!
                Fleas can travel on clothing (yes, yours!), so preventative treatment for your floofy friends can save
                you a
                lot of trouble. Similarly, myxomatosis and Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease (RVHD) can reach your
                free-roam
                rabbits via insects and textiles, including shoes and other clothing. Keep them safe by booking the buns
                in
                for regular vaccinations with your trusted vet.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                At Kavee, we think free-roam rabbits are the future. Although bunny-proofing your home and
                toilet-training
                your free-roaming rabbits takes a bit of work, your sweet friends will be happier and healthier with all
                this extra space - take Coco's word for it.
                Hoppy times!
